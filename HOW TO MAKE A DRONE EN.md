## Preparation of material

### 1.0  Summary

This chapter introduced the selection of material and chips, in order to buy stuff cheaply. ~~I DONT HAVE MONEY~~

### 1.1 Selection of material

**Electronic speed Controller**

Why we need it? As it is designed for converting control signal into current to control the rotating speed of motor.

How to read the parameters? On the specification there's a maximum current it can offer.

**Brushless electric machine**

WHAT THE HELL IS 2212? Its a model type of the brushless electric machine, for example, 2212 , the fore-22 refers to the diameter, and the rear-12 refers to its height. Easy!

KV? KV is the rotating speed per minute increasing by 1 volt pd.
